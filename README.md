Your digital photo frame moves to the web! Create a slide show within your Chrome browser.

Site Deck is a free extension that allows you to specify multiple web url's you want to display either in your monitor or a TV screen. Site Deck will then cycle through these urls and show them one at a time on your screen. 

The default time interval is 10secs but you can specify any time in milliseconds you want to stay between urls.
